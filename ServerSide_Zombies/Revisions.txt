2nd of October 2020 - Snufkin Custom Zombies (A19.1 - b.8)

What an awesome mod. It was unfortunate it wasn't compatible with latter A19 builds.

Here are a few changes which restore functionality to the point that there are no game breaking errors and minimal console warnings...........so far. Time will tell on this though and I hope you can test and share feedback.

Over a period of extended play, these changes may or may not cause their own issues, or reduce initial features, but it's a temporary workaround until someone with the time and experience can dig in.

== Changes in order of finding them in the console as warnings or game breakers ==
----------------------------------
1. Juggernaut Zombie Issue
entityclasses.xml
entity_class name="Zombie_Template"

Crude edit but changed the following property to a comment for the time being as this is causing the Juggernaut Zombie to sink below the ground surface by one block and cause a looping 'NullReferenceException'

<!--property name="AvatarController" value="AvatarZombieUMAController" /-->

Based on forum posts, this appears to be an area of contention. He runs with it removed.
----------------------------------
2. Scorcher Zombie Issue
entityclasses.xml
entity_class name="zombieScorcher"

Crude edit but changed the following property to a comment for the time being as this is causing the Scorcher Zombie to not appear at all and cause a looping 'NullReferenceException'

<!--property name="Mesh" value="Zombies/zombieStandardDemolitionRagdoll"/-->

This allows it to spawn and fall back on it's parent class with:
<property name="Mesh" value="#Entities/Zombies?Zombies/zombieStandardSoldierRagdoll.prefab"/>
----------------------------------
3. Buff Health Issue - ParasiteAttack
buffs.xml
buff name="ParasiteAttack"

Crude edit but changed the following property to a comment for the time being as this appears to be causing a buffs.xml failure.

<!--passive_effect name="HealthMaxModifierOT" operation="base_subtract" value="1"/-->
----------------------------------
4. Ragdoll Issue
entityclasses.xml
entity_class name="Zombie_Template"

The console suggests the property for <property name="Mesh" value="Zombies/zombie01Ragdoll" /> cannot be found. This has been commented out so it will fall back on its "zombieTemplateMale" value of <property name="Mesh" value="#Entities/Zombies?Zombies/zombieStandardBoeRagdoll.prefab"/> which isn't causing any console warnings.
----------------------------------
5. Typo Amendment from Geits to Geist changed in:
entityclasses.xml
entity_class name="zombieGeist"

and associated items.xml partners. Purely cosmtic as they all associated under the same typo anyway.
----------------------------------
6. Archon Issue
entityclasses.xml
entity_class name="ZombieArchon"

The Archon character is special and doesn't require an archetype because it is an overlay of an existing character. Archon wouldn't spawn and gave a warning of:

NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
  at EntityAlive.Update () [0x00134] in <b96846cfb0544c2da3579e57837d9053>:0
 
(Filename: <b96846cfb0544c2da3579e57837d9053> Line: 0)

Through a process of elimination, the culprit was found to be <!--property name="ReplaceMaterial1" value="entities/zombies/materials/rad_eye"/-->  and this was replaced with <property name="ReplaceMaterial1" value="#Entities/Zombies?Zombies/Materials/rad_eye.mat"/>  linked back to the parent character.

----------------------------------
7. Banshee Issue.
entityclasses.xml
entity_class name="zombieBanshee"

Crude edit but changed the following property to a comment for the time being as this is causing the Banshee Zombie to not appear at all and cause a looping 'NullReferenceException'

<!--property name="Mesh" value="Zombies/zombieStandardDemolitionRagdoll"/-->

This allows it to spawn and fall back on it's parent class with:
<property name="Mesh" value="#Entities/Zombies?Zombies/zombieStandardBoeHDFeralRagdoll.prefab"/>

===============================================================================
Summary on testing so far - Able to use without crashing or locking up YES / NO
===============================================================================
1. Archon - YES / Does bring up a yellow warning though. 'Particle System is trying to spawn on a mesh with zero surface area'. Hard to say if it's a server busting warning for the long term.

2. Banshee - YES / No warnings at all so far. Clear cut.

3. Scorcher - YES / Does bring up a yellow warning though. 'Particle System is trying to spawn on a mesh with zero surface area'. Hard to say if it's a server busting warning for the long term.

4. Bomber - YES / No warnings at all so far. Blastastic.

5. Cowhead - YES / No warnings at all so far. Mooooover and a shaker.

6. Geist - YES / No warnings at all so far. 'Shocking'.

7. Juggernaut - YES / Occasional warnings about the vehicle scraps and animator got state but so far. I have a 'soft spot' for Juggernaut as he's the first one I started on.

8. Mantis - YES / No warnings at all so far. Far out.

9. Parasite - YES / No warnings at all so far. 'Suckulent.'

10. Scarecrow - YES / Has an odd death spin animation which I am not touching. Pimpking.

11. Undertaker - YES / No warnings at all so far. Bone shakingly good.

12. Wendigo - YES / No warnings at all so far. Flies like the wind.

13. Wrestler - YES / No warnings at all so far. Just wants to be hugged.

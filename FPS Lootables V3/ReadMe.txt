***** MADE FOR ALPHA 21 *****


***** FPS Lootables *****



After extracting the downloaded 7z file contents just place the entire folder
"FPS Lootables" into your Mods folder and you should be ready to go. 
Installs just like almost every mod. Some of the loot containers will require a 
new game but MOST will work on an existing save.

This mod will enable many new lootable items like damaged vehicles, tractors,
excavators, backhoes, forklifts, plastic barrels, wooden barrels, ice machines,
broken vending machines, electrical utility panels, gas meters, air conditioners, 
table saws, fire hydrants and all the gore items like body bags and various corpses.

Most of the gore items require a new game or a visit to a unexplored portion of 
the map.

I tried to keep a "theme" to the loot on the items... like tractors will have seeds
and barrels will have high tier food and drinks. Electric panels will have electrical
items, and so forth! 

Because there is so many new lootable items, I kept the amount of items in each one
very low to still keep the game challenging without going overboard on loot. 

I hope you enjoy the mod!
